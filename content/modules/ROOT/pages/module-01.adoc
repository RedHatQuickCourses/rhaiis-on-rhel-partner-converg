= Using Red Hat AI Inference Server

In this lab, you will be using Red Hat AI Inference Server, running in a container on RHEL 9.5 and serving the Llama-3-Groq-8B model.
In order to get the inference server running you would need to pull its image from the registry and then create and run a container with that image.

To save you time, the image that will be used in the container has been pre-pulled and is already available in your RHEL host.
The RHEL server has, by default, an NVIDIA L4 GPU with 24Gb of memory. 
As we said in the introduction, Red Hat AI Inference Server can use many other accelerators. 
The RHAIIS container has been created and it is already running on the host.


== Monitor GPU utilization

. Check that the RHAIIS systemd service is running, start by working in the top terminal.

[source,sh,role=execute]
----
sudo systemctl status rhaiis
----

          "is_blocking": false
        }
      ]
    }
  ]
}
----
+

We can see that the model `RedHatAI/gemma-3-1b-it-quantized.w8a8` is available.
+

// TODO: Add the model description here and explanation

. Check the GPU utilization by using the *nvtop* command in the bottom terminal. You can Exit at anytime by using either the kbd:[q] or kdb:[Esc] key.
+

[source,sh,role=execute]
----
nvtop

+

NOTE: The ouput may not match the above and will vary depending on the GPU utilization, the GPU type, and the model being used.


== Query Red Hat AI Inference Server

. In the top terminal, submit this query using the `curl` command. The request is long enough that the GPU will be fully utilized for a short while.
+

[source,bash,role=execute,subs=attributes+]
----
curl -X POST http://localhost:8000/v1/chat/completions \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "model": "RedHatAI/gemma-3-1b-it-quantized.w8a8",
    "messages": [
      {
        "role": "user",
        "content": "Write me 5 to 10 paragraphs about RHEL"
      }
    ],
    "temperature": 0.7,
    "max_tokens": 1500
  }' | jq

        "reasoning_content": null,
        "content": "

        "tool_calls": []
      },

      "stop_reason": 106
    }
  ],
  "usage": {
    "prompt_tokens": 21,
    "total_tokens": 732,
    "completion_tokens": 711,
    "prompt_tokens_details": null
  },
  "prompt_logprobs": null
}
----

Look at the termial where the GPU monitor is running and you will see how its resources are being used until the response is displayed. 
At the end of the response, you will see the usage data.
+

Try a few more queries by adjusting the content in the API call above and see how the GPU resources are used.

=== Using OpenAI API

Now, you will use OpenAI API to query Red Hat AI Inference Server.
This is really useful if we want applications to be able to communicate with it. 
OpenAI API has become a standard as it supports stateful interactions, function calling, and integration with external tools and data, making it a powerful resource for building intelligent applications.

. We will create a Python script that will submit the query to the Red Hat AI Inference Server. But before we need to install the OpenAI library.
+

[source,bash,role=execute,subs=attributes+]
----
pip install openai
----
+

----

. Create a Python script that will submit the query to the Red Hat AI Inference Server.
+

As you can see in the simple script below, it is creating a client that asks our model why Red Hat AI Inference Server is good for RHEL.
In here we already have a dummy api_key configured.
+

[source,bash,role=execute,subs=attributes+]
----
cat << 'EOF' > api.py
from openai import OpenAI

api_key = "llamastack"

model = "RedHatAI/gemma-3-1b-it-quantized.w8a8"
base_url = "http://localhost:8000/v1/"

client = OpenAI(
    base_url=base_url,
    api_key=api_key,
)

response = client.chat.completions.create(
    model=model,
    messages=[
        {"role": "system", "content": "You are a helpful assistant."},
        {"role": "user", "content": "Why is Red Hat AI Inference Server a great fit for RHEL?"}
    ]
)
print(response.choices[0].message.content)
EOF
----
+

. Run the python script using the following command
+
[source,sh,role=execute]
----
python api.py
----
+
NOTE: The output is omitted as there will a degree of non-determinisim in it, however expect a lengthy response on topic.


Once again, you can see in the GPU monitor how its resources are being utilized until the response is returned.

Try a few more queries by adjusing the content in the Python script or the *curl* command to see how the GPU resources are used and the accuracy of the responses.


== Conclusion
