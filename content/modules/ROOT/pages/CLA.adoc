=== Understanding CLA 

In this section we will try to understand different components of command-line-assistant.

* Verify if package is installed.

[source,bash,role=execute,subs=attributes+]
---- 
rpm -qa | grep command-line-assistant 
----

* List out the configuration files and libraries

[source,bash,role=execute,subs=attributes+]
---- 
rpm -ql command-line-assistant | grep -v /usr
----

* Check configuration file for command-line-assistant and as shown in snippet, look for `endpoint` parameter.

``` 
# less /etc/xdg/command-line-assistant/config.toml
......
[backend]
# The endpoint points to an API server.
endpoint = "https://cert.console.redhat.com/api/lightspeed/v1"
......
```

* Check the service status

```

== How to use CLA 

Using the command-line assistant powered by RHEL Lightspeed on RHEL systems.

The command-line assistant powered by RHEL Lightspeed is designed to assist both less experienced and experienced users to interact with RHEL by using the command-line interface. The command-line assistant can help you with tasks such as: answering RHEL related questions, assisting with troubleshooting, assisting with deciphering log entries, and many other tasks.

WARNING: Do not rely on the results from AI tools without human review. Always check the AI and LLM-generated responses for accuracy before using the generated suggestions.

==== **1. Ask questions**

Talk to the command-line-assistant and ask for any RHEL related questions. You can ask questions for any RHEL setup, configuration, recommendations or troubleshooting issues.

``` 
[root@rhaiis ~]# c "List out security features in RHEL just with titles?"

```

* Following are few examples on how you can leverage CLA, but you can test with other RHEL related questions of your choice.

``` 
# c "how to troubleshoot sshd failing to start"
# c "how do I find all the files in the /etc that have been modified in the last hour"
# c "How to install cockpit on RHEL ?"
# c "where to add NTP servers for time syncing ?"
# c "how do I configure the dns server to 8.8.8.8 from the command line?"
# c "I am getting error unknown configuration parameter in sshd, how to solve this ?"
```

==== **2. Attach files to your questions**

You can attach a file to the command-line assistant powered by RHEL Lightspeed. By doing so, the assistant can provide a tailored response based on that file.

* For example, if you want to replicate the volume group, logical volumes, and file systems on another system, you can create a file with the storage information, and run the command-line assistant to get information about the required steps to replicate that specific storage partition in another system. For example:


[source,bash,role=execute,subs=attributes+]
----
lsblk > storage_info ; c --attachment storage_info "how can I replicate the storage configuration in another system ?"
----

* Optionally, use the short version of the attachment command. For example:

``` 
# c -a storage_info "how can I replicate the storage configuration in another system ?"
```

==== **3. Redirecting a command output to the command line assistant**

* Use the log file that contains information that you want to understand by redirecting that log file output to command-line assistant powered by RHEL Lightspeed.

``` 
# cat <log_file.log> | c
```

* If the error or log that you have provided to the command-line assistant does not provide enough information, you can combine the redirect output with a question, for example:

```
# dmesg | grep error
[    7.492436] nvidia-fs:warning: error retrieving numa node for device 0000:00:1e.0
```

* Redirect this error output to cla.

[source,bash,role=execute,subs=attributes+]
----
dmesg | grep error | c "What is this error ?"
----

==== **4. Capture terminal activity**


* Enable the terminal capture for your current terminal session. For example:

```
# c shell --enable-capture
```

* Run at least one command before you reference previous commands.
* After you enable the capture, you can reference the previous output of a command that you ran. For example, to reference the last command, run:

```
# c -w 1 "what_is_this"
```

* To reference the second to last command, run:

```
# c -w 2 "what_is_this"
```

* To stop terminal capture, press the following keys on your keyboard:

```
$ Press Ctrl + D
```

==== **5. Checking history interactions**

Access your conversation history with the command-line assistant powered by RHEL Lightspeed.

* Fetch all user history. For example: 

``` 
# c history --all
```

* Filter your history conversation to search for a term to retrieve all questions and answers related to that word. For example:
 

``` 
# c history --filter “podman”
```

* Clear all the user history:

``` 
# c history --clear
```
