= Welcome

Red Hat welcomes you for this partner convergence workshop. 

We have two workshops lined up for you. 

1. Workshop 1 
This workshop introduces command-line-assistant powered by Red Hat Lightspeed. 

With Red Hat lightspeed, we are integrating Gen-AI within our enterprise products, so that customer's are well-equipped with all the Red Hat product knowledge within the product itself. 

You will install command line assistant, ask questions and get troubleshooting help from the CLA.

2. Workshop 2 

Red Hat® AI is engineered to help you build and run AI solutions that work exactly how your business does—from first experiments to full production.

Red Hat offers a comprehensive suite of AI/ML solutions designed for enterprise environments. The Red Hat AI Inference Server (RHAIIS) supports efficient model serving at scale, while Red Hat OpenShift AI (RHOAI) provides an end-to-end platform for model development, training, and deployment. Together, they enable organizations to operationalize AI across hybrid cloud infrastructures.
